# AminoAcidsCounter
This is a graphical implementation of my code for properties of peptides here[https://github.com/sviatkh/bioinformatics/blob/main/protein%20properties%20for%20Diploma]

It's easy to use. You need to give a name for peptide you are going to analyze and paste the amino acid sequence. 
After pasting the sequence it'll calculate the number of specified amino acids and it's percentage in the pepride/protein. 
And finally the app will plot the graph based on calculations.
